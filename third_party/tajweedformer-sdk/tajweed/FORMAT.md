# expected_tj3.zfx: the expected table of the tajweed scorer

One file per model folder (`sdk/v4.0/expected_tj3.zfx`). It holds, for every ayah of the Hafs reading, the expected
tj3 token sequence, the word of every token, the per-token site metadata, the madd entries and every legal form of
every word. It is made from the expected table `expected_tj3.jsonl.gz` (built with quran-g2p) by `tools/zfexpected.py` and read by
`tajweed/src/expected.c`. It holds no Arabic text, only token ids of `tokens.txt`.

All integers are little-endian. Every section starts on a 4-byte boundary (zero padding between sections). Readers
read bytes, never aligned words, and check every offset and count against the file size before use.

## Header (160 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | magic `ZFTJEXP1` |
| 8 | 4 | format version, 1 |
| 12 | 4 | header size, 160 |
| 16 | 4 | file size in bytes |
| 20 | 4 | surahs (114) |
| 24 | 4 | ayahs (6,236 for the full table) |
| 28 | 4 | tokens, all ayahs together |
| 32 | 4 | madd entries, all ayahs together |
| 36 | 4 | bytes of the forms section |
| 40 | 32 | sha256 of the source `expected_tj3.jsonl.gz` |
| 72 | 32 | sha256 of the `tokens.txt` the ids refer to (the SDK refuses a table made against another tokens.txt) |
| 104 | 32 | section offsets, 8 x u32: ayah counts, ayah index, tokens, words, token flags, madd, forms, names |
| 136 | 24 | zero |

## Sections

- **Ayah counts**: u16 per surah. Ayah `a` of surah `s` is record `sum(counts[0 .. s-2]) + a - 1` of the index.
- **Ayah index**: 20 bytes per ayah, in reading order: u32 first token, u32 first madd entry, u32 byte offset of the
  ayah's forms in the forms section, u16 tokens, u16 madd entries, u8 words, 3 zero bytes.
- **Tokens**: u8 tj3 id per token (1 to 36: `|` between words, consonants, the nasal, vowels; never blank or
  `<foreign>`). This is the sequence `zf_tajweed_expected_tokens` returns: the canonical reading (ibtida at the
  first word, wasl inside, the pausal sukun form at the ayah's end).
- **Words**: u8 per token, the 0-based word; a `|` belongs to the word before it.
- **Token flags**: u16 per token:

  | Bits | Meaning |
  |---|---|
  | 0 | geminate (shadda) consonant |
  | 1 | qalqalah site (the release rule's site: b j d T q with no vowel after) |
  | 2-3 | qalqalah expected: 0 none, 1 sughra, 2 kubra (attr_qalqalah classes) |
  | 4-6 | ghunna expected: attr_ghunna class 0 to 4 |
  | 7-8 | tafkheem expected: attr_tafkheem class 0 to 2 |
  | 9-11 | madd class of the entry at this token: 0 none, 1 fixed2, 2 muttasil, 3 free, 4 lazim, 5 consonant length |
  | 12-15 | zero |

- **Madd**: 8 bytes per entry, sorted by token within an ayah: u16 token index in the ayah, u8 class (1 fixed2,
  2 muttasil, 3 free, 4 lazim, 5 consonant length: leen and ghunna lengths, not on the madd ladder), u8 kind (0
  fixed, 1 free), u8 allowed counts (bit c = count c), u8 scoring counts (bit c = count c accepted), u8 canonical
  count, u8 flags (bit 0: the entry's base is a madd letter, alef_madd / waw_madd / yeh_madd / alef_imala; the
  scorer counts only those).
- **Forms**: per ayah, per word in order:
  - u8 word flags (bit 0: a stop is allowed after this word);
  - u8 distinct token strings, then each: u8 length and that many u8 token ids (no `|`);
  - u8 forms (at least 1), then each 4 bytes: u8 flags, u8 string index, u16 wajh name (0 none, else an index into
    the names section). Flags: bit 0 L is ibtida (else wasl), bit 1 R is waqf (else wasl), bits 2-4 mode (0 plain,
    1 sukun, 2 rawm, 3 ishmam), bit 5 cross-ayah form.

  Every form of the row is stored, in the row's order, followed by the cross-ayah forms (`cross_ayah.prev` on the
  first word, `cross_ayah.next` on the last): the path search keeps the earlier form on a tie, so the order is part
  of the data.
- **Names**: u32 count, then each: u8 length and that many UTF-8 bytes (the wajh names of the khilaf forms). Name
  ids count from 1.

## How the scorer uses the forms

As the reference scorer (`tajweed_ref.lattice_path`): one form per word with agreeing boundary states (a form with
L ibtida follows a stop, L wasl follows a wasl ending or a cross-ayah start; R waqf ends in a stop), the minimum
edit distance to the greedy decode of log_probs, the earlier form on a tie, a stop before a wasl ending on a tie.
The chosen path is the expected sequence the take is scored against, so a legal stop, ibtida, rawm, khilaf wajh or
wasl across the ayah boundary is never a mistake.

## Size

The full table (expected_tj3.jsonl.gz sha256 ea5159cb..., 6,236 ayahs, 542,325 tokens, 67,489 madd entries, 7
wajh names) converts to 5,489,848 bytes (forms 2,655,405 of them), 1,004,498 bytes gzipped (`gzip -9`), zfx sha256
4e17b776b3b88b4d6d45f39ebf49654aa9593501ce7053b18152e57f1271cdc6. The synthetic test table (`tests/data/model`) is a few
kB.
